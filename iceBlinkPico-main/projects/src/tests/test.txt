# Expected Register Values Before and After Test Operations

# Initial Register State (All registers initialized to 0)
x0  = 0x00000000  # Zero register (always 0)
...
x31 = 0x00000000  

# Expected Values After Writing to Registers
# Assume the following instructions were executed:
# addi x5, x0, 10  (x5 = 10)
# addi x10, x0, 20 (x10 = 20)
# add x15, x5, x10 (x15 = x5 + x10 = 30)

x5  = 0x0000000A  # 10 in decimal
x10 = 0x00000014  # 20 in decimal
x15 = 0x0000001E  # 30 in decimal

# Ensure x0 remains 0 after any writes
x0  = 0x00000000  # Must always be 0
